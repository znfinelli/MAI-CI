Getting started — Evolution Strategies project
=============================================

This short guide shows how to set up a Python virtual environment, install the required
packages from `requirements.txt`, and run the Evolution Strategies experiments on macOS
(zsh). Follow the steps below.

1) Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

	Open a terminal in the project root (the folder containing `Evolution_strategies.py`) and run:

	```bash
	# create a virtual environment named .venv
	python3 -m venv .venv

	# activate the virtual environment (zsh)
	source .venv/bin/activate
	```

2) Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

	With the virtual environment active, install the required packages:

	```bash
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

	The `requirements.txt` in this project includes:
	- numpy >= 1.19.0
	- matplotlib >= 3.3.0
	- pandas >= 1.1.0

3) Run a quick local test (optional)

	A quick test script `quick_test.py` is included for faster verification. Run it like this:

	```bash
	python quick_test.py
	```

	This runs a few short trials of the ES implementation on the Sphere function and prints
	basic statistics. Use it to sanity-check the environment before launching full experiments.

4) Run the full experiments

	To run the main experiments (longer), execute:

	```bash
	python Evolution_strategies.py
	```

	Output (CSV and PNG files) will be produced in the working directory or in the configured
	output path inside the script.

5) Deactivate the virtual environment

	When you're done:

	```bash
	deactivate
	```

Notes
-----
- If you have multiple Python versions installed, ensure `python3` points to the
  interpreter you intend to use. Use `python3 -m pip` if you need to be explicit.
- To reduce runtime during development, you can edit `Evolution_strategies.py` or use
  `quick_test.py` which contains a faster test configuration.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- ModuleNotFoundError: make sure the virtual environment is activated and that
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully.
- Performance issues: reduce `n_runs` in the `ExperimentRunner` or lower `max_generations`.

If you want, I can also add a small Makefile or a shell script to automate these steps.
